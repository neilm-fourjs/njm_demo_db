# My Demo Database

This demos also uses the g2_lib for the library code, so make sure to also check that out.

You can build using the GeneroStudio project file or on Linux you can use the makefile ( which will use the GeneroStudio project file )

NOTE: You can also clone 'git@github.com:neilm-fourjs/njm_resources.git' which contains the product images, if found the njm_demo_db will image more stock items for those images in njm_resources/products/<category>

# Building:
Set the Genero Environment then:
```
git clone git@github.com:neilm-fourjs/g2_lib.git
git clone git@github.com:neilm-fourjs/njm_demo_db.git
cd njm_demo_db/
make run
```
